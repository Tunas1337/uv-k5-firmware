# Open reimplementation of the Quan Sheng UV K5 v2.1.27 firmware

This repository is a preservation project of the UV K5 v2.1.27 firmware.
It is dedicated to understanding how the radio works and help developers making their own customisations/fixes/etc.
It is by no means fully understood or has all variables/functions properly named, as this is best effort only.
As a result, this repository will not include any customisations or improvements over the original firmware.

You can find such firmware at the following repositories:

* https://github.com/fagci/uv-k5-firmware-fagci-mod

# Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

# Building

To build the firmware, you need to fetch the submodules and then run make:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1
make
```
